Polish game flow
- make sure ordered dialogue works
- make sure strikes can't happen while you're in dialogue
   - have ending dialogue be dependent on character not talking
   - new ones can only be added if they don't have current characters
   - have some way of setting to make dialogue exclusive, like first one
      - first dialogue sent 
- full game flow, from main menu to game
- make sure required tags works (rn just returning true) 
- make sure dialogue only gets activated once, and is ignored if jack is taken out 
- day end stuff









Make sure switch positioning in "switchboard space" and not world space

Lock in button 

Event based display location stuff (when a new call is added, something needs to display that its there)
- lights 
visual for timer
- how to visualize when jacked in?
improve lock in visual 
positioning
visual for strikes
working clock?

implement map

Locations should only be inputted characters and not manually set, randomize locations

what happens if a call comes in and you already have jack there? 

entirely randomize locations

gamefeel
- squash and stretch for buttons
- screenshake for strike, maybe on click
- generally more movement


get writers in on things


If a call comes in while the same jack is in
- boot the jack (play a little sound effect)
