Make sure switch positioning in "switchboard space" and not world space

Lock in button 

Event based display location stuff (when a new call is added, something needs to display that its there)
- lights 
visual for timer
- how to visualize when jacked in?
improve lock in visual 
positioning
visual for strikes
working clock?

implement map

Locations should only be inputted characters and not manually set, randomize locations

what happens if a call comes in and you already have jack there? 

entirely randomize locations

gamefeel
- squash and stretch for buttons
- screenshake for strike, maybe on click
- generally more movement


get writers in on things


If a call comes in while the same jack is in
- boot the jack (play a little sound effect)
